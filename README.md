# US Auto Repair Jobs

**Where Automotive Talent Meets Opportunity** — a job platform for auto repair & auto body technicians and the shops that hire them. An Indeed alternative built specifically for the trade.

## Run it locally

**Node** (same as production):

```
npm start
```

…then open **http://localhost:8080**.

Or with Python: `python -m http.server 8080`. Or double-click **`START-US-AUTO-REPAIR-JOBS.bat`** on Windows.

> 100% static front end (HTML/CSS/JS). Accounts, jobs, applications, subscriptions, and invoices are stored in your browser's `localStorage`, so it's fully interactive with no database. Clearing site data resets the demo.

## Deploy on Railway

The repo is Railway-ready:

- `package.json` → `npm start` runs `server.js` (a zero-dependency Node static server that binds `process.env.PORT`).
- `Procfile` → `web: npm start`.

On Railway: **New Project → Deploy from GitHub → chrispeer69/Wrenchlink**. Nixpacks detects Node and runs `npm start` automatically. No build step or env vars required.
